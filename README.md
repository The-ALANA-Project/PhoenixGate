## Overview
Phoenix Gate is a mobile app (iOS/Android) enabling seamless verification of **Unlock Protocol**-based tickets and memberships using [**burner.pro**](https://www.burner.pro/) hardware wallet cards across multiple chains.  
Designed for real-world use, it helps event organizers and Web3 communities easily connect onchain credentials with IRL experiences—securely, simply, and without complex wallet setup.

The first live pilot will be run with [**Digital Spenders Club**](https://www.spenders.club), exploring how tokenized memberships and AMP-priced access passes can power community-driven cultural events. Amplification and documentation of the outcomes will be supported by **The ALANA Project**.

## Chains Enabled
- [x] Base
- [x] Arbitrum
- [x] Optimism
- [ ] coming soon

## Core Goals
- Make **onchain access frictionless** for event organizers and members.  
- Enable **ticket and membership verification** via burner wallet cards.  
- Support **payments and memberships priced in AMP** or other ERC-20 tokens.  
- Create a **replicable model** for how decentralized tools can power IRL event coordination.  
- Strengthen interoperability between **Unlock Protocol, burner.pro, AMP, and community-led projects**.  

## Why It Matters
Phoenix Gate moves digital payments and memberships from speculation to everyday cultural and community use. By aligning protocols and creators in a single access flow, it demonstrates that token-based coordination can extend meaningfully into real-world gatherings.
