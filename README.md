## Overview
Phoenix Gate is a mobile app (iOS/Android) enabling seamless verification of **Unlock Protocol**-based tickets and memberships using [**burner.pro**](https://www.burner.pro/) hardware wallet cards across multiple chains.  
Designed for real-world use, it helps event organizers and Web3 communities easily connect onchain credentials with IRL experiences—securely, simply, and without complex wallet setup.

The first live pilot will be run with [**Digital Spenders Club**](https://www.spenders.club/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnoFmUd0w05z863HVd0dMB1SUEphv_7ecPZLikt6tpD58MuhJc), exploring how tokenized memberships and AMP-priced access passes can power community-driven cultural events. Amplification and documentation of the outcomes will be supported by **The ALANA Project**.
