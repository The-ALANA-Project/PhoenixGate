## Overview
Phoenix Gate is a mobile app (iOS/Android) that enables event organizers and communities to verify onchain ticket and membership ownership using [**Unlock Protocol**](https://unlock-protocol.com/), with credentials stored on [**burner.pro**](https://www.burner.pro/) hardware wallet cards across multiple chains.  

Its core use case is real-world access control for conferences and side events—settings that drive meaningful networking, collaboration, and creativity across the Web3 ecosystem. Today, most of these events rely on centralized ticketing platforms and manual check-in processes. Phoenix Gate replaces this flow with a fully onchain access stack that is fast, reliable, and practical to run on-site.

Attendees receive tickets or memberships issued via Unlock Protocol and store their credentials on a portable burner wallet card. At the venue, access is verified in seconds by the organizer with the Phoenix Gate app; no private key handling, or complicated setup required.  

While the initial pilots explore token-based pricing using AMP in collaboration with [**Digital Spenders Club**](https://www.spenders.club), the broader objective is to normalize onchain credentials and payments as part of everyday cultural and professional gatherings. Over time, Phoenix Gate aims to make decentralized verification and tokenized access a default layer of the modern event experience.

## Core Goals
- Provide rapid, reliable, and user‑friendly **onchain ticket verification** for live events.  
- Reduce event check‑in friction while maintaining accessibility for non‑technical attendees.  
- Establish a **repeatable open‑source model** for decentralized access control at conferences and gatherings.  
- Support **flexible token pricing and settlement**, with AMP and other assets integrated as examples of practical, real‑world usage.  
- Strengthen collaboration across protocols and communities by demonstrating **interoperability between Unlock, burner.pro, and payment networks**. 

## Why It Matters
Event passes and memberships are one of the most tangible, high‑frequency ways people interact with value—digital or otherwise. Yet in Web3, these interactions often remain siloed between wallets, protocols, and ticketing services.

Phoenix Gate brings those worlds together. It shows how onchain credentials and token settlements can underpin real‑world coordination, enabling crypto‑native access, verification, and payments in simple, portable flows. The project also serves as a blueprint for how different ecosystem players—wallet providers, DAOs, and payment networks—can work together to make tokenized experiences frictionless and inclusive. 

## Impact Tracking
- Number of conferences, organizers, and communities using Phoenix Gate in the first year.  
- Number of **Unlock‑based tickets or memberships** issued and verified via burner wallet cards.  
- Share of events adopting onchain pricing or settlement (AMP or comparable tokens).  
- Average check‑in time per attendee and reduction in manual verification errors.  
- Repository activity and open‑source adoption by external developers or communities.  
- Qualitative feedback from organizers, attendees, and partners collected during pilot cycles.
